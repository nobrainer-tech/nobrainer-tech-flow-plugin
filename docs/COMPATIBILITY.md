# nobrainer-tech-flow compatibility evidence

nobrainer-tech-flow keeps one portable `skills/` source, but portability is
not the same as a proven client integration. Record these levels separately:

1. `SOURCE_VALIDATED` — the portable `SKILL.md` folders pass repository
   validators; this makes no client claim.
2. `REPOSITORY_CHECKED` — the manifest, hook, plugin or installer has a
   deterministic local parse or execution test against the repository's frozen
   contract; this does not prove the client accepts it.
3. `CLIENT_LOADED` — the exact installed client version accepts the package and
   reports the expected skills or bootstrap as loaded.
4. `RUNTIME_VERIFIED_EXPLICIT` — a clean client session loads and follows the
   canonical body under explicit invocation; this does not prove discovery.
5. `RUNTIME_VERIFIED` — a clean client session discovers and follows
   `nobrainer-tech-flow` without manually pasting its body.
6. `DISTRIBUTED` — the exact release is available through the claimed public
   marketplace or install channel and was read back after installation.

Never promote one level from evidence belonging to another.
Merge is a repository delivery state, not a client-compatibility level; release
evidence records it separately.

The current source version is **2.1.1**. Its release scope and proof limits are
recorded in the [2.1.1 verification record](releases/v2.1.1.md), which refines
the communication defaults of [2.1.0](releases/v2.1.0.md).
It builds on the [2.0.2 installer record](releases/v2.0.2.md).
The [2.0.0](releases/v2.0.0.md) and [1.14.1](releases/v1.14.1.md) records are
historical evidence, not statements about the current source. The package/entrypoint migration
is documented in the [migration guide](MIGRATION_TO_FLOW.md).

For 2.0.x, portable structure, installation, selected setup, personalization,
update checks and guarded cleanup have repository-level tests. The historical
client matrix below does not establish fresh 2.0 automatic discovery,
parallel execution, live Jev/Laya access or marketplace acceptance.
Source release availability must be verified separately against its public tag.
The unchanged command runner retains its scoped [v1.7.0 evidence](releases/v1.7.0.md).

The 1.6.1 instruction review
clarifies skill precedence and sufficient verification. Its evidence is a
source-contract review; the v1.6 runtime results apply only to the archived
release bytes. It adds no model-wide or cross-client runtime claim.

The source channel was `DISTRIBUTED` for `v1.5.0`, with its exact historical
merge, tag and installation in the [publication evidence](releases/v1.5.0-publication-readback.md).
That record and [v1.3.1](releases/v1.3.1-publication-readback.md) remain rollback evidence. Pin a reviewed full
commit SHA when immutability matters. Neither source publication nor an installed
folder proves marketplace acceptance or model behavior.

## Model-neutral readiness

`WORKFLOW_READY` is a product-positioning label, not a seventh compatibility
level. It means the portable policy can carry a selected model, effort, budget
and escalation gate; it does not prove that a provider exposes or follows that
policy.

| Model / family | Workflow posture | Runtime evidence |
|---|---|---|
| GPT-6 Astra | `WORKFLOW_READY`: host-selected policy, optional native capabilities | Bounded v1.6 Codex behavioral probes; exact source and limits in the [release evidence](releases/v1.6.0.md) |
| Other OpenAI models | Same portable instructions and policy | Only exact tested model IDs in the release evidence; no family-wide pass |
| Claude models | Same portable instructions and policy | Historical explicit client evidence below; no automatic claim for a new model |
| Other models / clients | Portable Markdown plus available tools | Unverified until tested in that host |

OpenAI [announced GPT-6 Astra](https://openai.com/index/gpt-6-astra/) on
2026-09-03. Names and access change; inspect the host's actual model list rather
than treating this document as a model catalogue. No provider is a dependency.

`v1.0.0` remains a separately verified nine-skill rollback anchor with its own
[publication readback](releases/v1.0.0.md).

The v1.3.0 source release has additional local runtime evidence in
[the historical harness evaluation](evals/v1.3.0-harness-clarity-2026-08-30.md)
and current behavioral evidence in
[the Autoimprove evaluation](evals/v1.3.0-autoimprove-integrity-2026-09-01.md).
The older client transcripts remain hash-scoped and do not silently upgrade to
marketplace or automatic-routing claims. Both clients retain explicit-runtime
evidence only; automatic routing and client publication remain unverified.

## Adapter contracts and historical client evidence

`REPOSITORY_CHECKED` below means deterministic repository tests passed. It does
not mean the external client's parser accepted or loaded the package.

| Client / harness | Source | Repository contract | Client load | Runtime | Distribution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `SOURCE_VALIDATED` | `REPOSITORY_CHECKED`: manifest, portable installer and Claude SessionStart output | `CLIENT_LOADED`: CLI `2.1.241`, isolated plugin, namespaced explicit invocation | `RUNTIME_VERIFIED_EXPLICIT`: final nobrainer-tech-flow route reached and read canonical Autoimprove; automatic routing remains unverified | `NOT_PUBLISHED` |
| Codex | `SOURCE_VALIDATED` | `REPOSITORY_CHECKED`: accepted manifest schema and portable installer | `CLIENT_LOADED`: CLI `0.149.1`, repo-scoped copy, explicit canonical invocation | `RUNTIME_VERIFIED_EXPLICIT`: final Luna cases and isolated implementation passed; automatic and alias-only routing remain unverified | `NOT_PUBLISHED` |
| Cursor | `SOURCE_VALIDATED` | `REPOSITORY_CHECKED`: manifest path and Cursor SessionStart output | `NOT_VERIFIED` | `NOT_VERIFIED` | `NOT_PUBLISHED` |
| OpenCode | `SOURCE_VALIDATED` | `REPOSITORY_CHECKED`: skills registration plus idempotent first-user transform | `NOT_VERIFIED` | `NOT_VERIFIED` | `NOT_PUBLISHED` |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `SOURCE_VALIDATED` | `REPOSITORY_CHECKED`: portable installer and repository instructions; no bootstrap | `NOT_VERIFIED` | `NOT_VERIFIED` | `NOT_PUBLISHED` |
| Gemini CLI | `SOURCE_VALIDATED` | `REPOSITORY_CHECKED`: extension manifest and owned context include | `NOT_VERIFIED` | `NOT_VERIFIED` | `NOT_PUBLISHED` |
| Kimi Code | `SOURCE_VALIDATED` | `REPOSITORY_CHECKED`: canonical skills path, `nobrainer-tech-flow` session-start field and native-tool boundary | `NOT_VERIFIED` | `NOT_VERIFIED` | `NOT_PUBLISHED` |
| Devin CLI | `SOURCE_VALIDATED` | no dedicated adapter | `NOT_VERIFIED` | `NOT_VERIFIED` | `NOT_PUBLISHED` |
| Pi | `SOURCE_VALIDATED` | `REPOSITORY_CHECKED`: package resources and per-request dedupe transform | `CLIENT_LOADED`: resource loader `0.87.1` only, no session (see the current-source readback) | `NOT_VERIFIED` | `NOT_PUBLISHED` |
| Hermes Agent | `SOURCE_VALIDATED` | `REPOSITORY_CHECKED`: root Agent Plugins v1 manifest only; no bootstrap | `NOT_VERIFIED` | `NOT_VERIFIED` | `NOT_PUBLISHED` |
| Antigravity and other plugin hosts | `SOURCE_VALIDATED` | no host-specific contract | `NOT_VERIFIED` | `NOT_VERIFIED` | `NOT_PUBLISHED` |
| Generic Agent Skills consumers | `SOURCE_VALIDATED` | canonical folders only | `NOT_VERIFIED` | `NOT_VERIFIED` | `NOT_PUBLISHED` |

Adapter checks apply to the current source. The client/runtime cells retain their
recorded historical versions and hashes; they do not silently transfer to the current source.
Consult the current release record for new probes. There is deliberately no blanket “works everywhere”
badge: an unknown harness gets portable skill folders, then needs its own
discovery/bootstrap proof before promotion.

## Adapter contract

All adapters point at the same eighteen directories. They may expose discovery and
one small `NOBRAINER_BOOTSTRAP_V1` routing context, but they must not copy or
rewrite skill bodies.

- Claude and Cursor hooks emit exactly one platform-specific JSON field.
- OpenCode and Pi detect their marker so one request never carries the bootstrap
  twice. OpenCode prefixes the first user message's text and, when that message
  has none (after a compaction), adds a synthetic text part. Pi adds it to every
  model request that lacks it, because the host rebuilds the message list per
  request.
- Gemini includes an extension-owned context file instead of changing a user's
  global instructions.
- Kimi maps native tools but explicitly refuses to treat a hidden subagent as
  proof of visible cross-session transport.
- Codex uses native skill discovery and has no hook entry or default
  `hooks/hooks.json` file. Claude points explicitly to
  `hooks/claude-hooks.json`, preventing Codex from auto-discovering the
  Claude-specific SessionStart adapter.
- The portable root manifest contains no client-specific bootstrap. Hermes can
  consume it through its Agent Plugins path, where skills remain namespaced and
  explicitly selected until a clean runtime transcript proves more.
- Copilot and Devin use portable skill folders and repository instructions only;
  no dedicated startup hook or client plugin contract is claimed.

## Current-source readback (2026-09-29)

Run against a checkout of the 2.0.1 source (2.0.2 changes no adapter or hook and
only the version in the manifests) with isolated client configuration and
no real model request: the Claude Code session ran against a local stand-in API
endpoint and Codex against a closed network, and both plugin installs used a
local checkout, not the GitHub source. The rows show what the client loads and
sends, not how a model behaves.

| Client | Readback | Level |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code `2.1.284` (Linux) | `claude plugin validate` passed. `claude plugin marketplace add` and `claude plugin install nobrainer-tech-flow@nobrainer-tech` installed 2.0.1 with 18 skills. The `SessionStart` hook exited 0 and the request to the model carried the `NOBRAINER_BOOTSTRAP_V1` context once. With `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` set, guided setup installed into that directory, the client listed the installed skills, the instruction block reached the request and `~/.claude` stayed untouched. | `CLIENT_LOADED`; bootstrap delivery observed; routing unverified |
| Codex `0.158.0` (Linux) | `codex plugin marketplace add` and `codex plugin add nobrainer-tech-flow@nobrainer-tech-skills-dev` installed 2.0.1. The model prompt listed 18 skills as `nobrainer-tech-flow:nobrainer-*`, and the plugin listing returned both default prompts. With 2.0.0 neither plugin name installed. | `CLIENT_LOADED`; routing unverified |
| Pi `0.87.1` (Linux, resource loader only) | The extension loaded with its `resources_discover` and `context` handlers, 18 skills and no diagnostics. | `CLIENT_LOADED` for the loader; no session |
| Windows (CI only: GitHub-hosted `windows-latest`, Git Bash, Python 3.11, Node 22) | The Windows smoke job passed on this source: both validators, the adapter tests and `tests/test_windows_smoke.py` (the `cmd` wrapper reaching the bootstrap through Git Bash, a copy-mode install, personalization with `CODEX_HOME`, the UTC session title). | `REPOSITORY_CHECKED` on Windows; no client read back |

The other rows above keep their earlier level: no readback of OpenCode, Cursor,
Gemini CLI, Kimi Code or Copilot CLI was made for this source. The Windows job
runs the validators and the modules listed in [Testing](TESTING.md), not the
whole suite.

## Clean-session acceptance

The approved-plan [autopilot loop](../skills/nobrainer-tech-flow/references/autopilot.md)
is development source after the v2.0.2 tag. It adds explicit select, execute,
check, review, correct and advance guidance.
It preserves the active client and its authority boundary. Source validation
and the deterministic lifecycle checks do not establish fresh automatic
discovery or unattended continuation in any client; those still need the
clean-session evidence below. This guidance adds no CLI executor or scheduler.

For each client, record the exact client version, model, operating system,
installation source and commit or release. Start with no project-specific rule
that names NoBrainer. Preserve the complete transcript and use these probes:

For a long-running probe, read back `SESSION_HEALTH_GATE` at `START`,
`AFTER_COMPACTION`, `MATERIAL_TRANSITION` and `BEFORE_CLOSEOUT`, using the
host/configured policy rather than assuming universal limits. Record
`UNKNOWN`/`UNSUPPORTED` signals and lower proof instead of guessing. Read back
`RUNTIME_RELEASE` separately: `task_complete` does not prove that task-owned
browser, tool or subprocess workers are closed.
Missing optional telemetry does not block safe bounded work or artifact acceptance;
it only limits the health claim. An explicitly required hard budget still needs
reliable enforcement. A configured warning checkpoints goal/TODO and prevents optional new workers or
large units; a hard threshold requires the clear/end-turn gate. Repository
examples are not universal host limits.
For resumable probes, persist one task-local Markdown `GOAL_FILE`. Before clear,
prove its checkpoint and no active writer, then record `CLEAR_MODE` and host
readback. After clear or a fresh turn, reload the file from disk and reconcile
identity, checkout and evidence; a transcript summary or host-native goal is not
the canonical recovery source.

### Automatic routing

The portable `ROUTED` policy describes how a plan may select an advertised
capability tier; it is not a cross-provider gateway. A client must read back the
actual model, effort and budget before claiming automatic routing. An unavailable
target is `MODEL_ESCALATION_PROPOSED` or `OWNER_APPROVAL`, never a silent
fallback.

```text
Use nobrainer-tech-flow to design and implement an ambiguous feature that crosses several modules
and may affect production.
```

Passing behavior:

- `nobrainer-tech-flow` is selected without pasting its body;
- the agent enters a short requirements/acceptance gate before writes;
- it creates one canonical plan and shows a compact Progress checklist;
- production effects remain owner-gated;
- it does not manufacture workers before work units exist.

### Correction and review loop

```text
I changed my mind: keep the public API unchanged. Update the plan accordingly.
```

Passing behavior: the old requirement is marked superseded, dependent TODO
items and evidence are invalidated, and the affected route is rebuilt without a
second ordinary clarification round. A simulated verified review finding must
return to Build and then fresh Review; it may not reuse the old green result.

### Explicit technical invocation

```text
$nobrainer-tech-flow Deliver this task with the smallest safe workflow.
```

Passing behavior: the client loads the nobrainer-tech-flow technical
`nobrainer-tech-flow` body and any
required relative reference without the user pasting either one.

### Compatibility alias control

```text
Use nobrainer-tech-flow to deliver this task with the smallest safe workflow.
Compatibility alias probe: use nb-ultra or nb-flow to deliver this task with the smallest safe workflow.
```

`nb-ultra`, `nb-flow` and `nb-workflow` are compatibility trigger phrases, not
the product name or additional skill names.
Record whether the client supports and selects it through implicit matching.
Do not present this as an explicit invocation guarantee. In the v1.3.0 Codex
probe, alias-only selection failed under a crowded skill catalog and a prompt
that prohibited file reads; the canonical `$nobrainer-tech-flow` probe passed.

### Non-trigger control

```text
Fix this obvious typo in README.md.
```

Passing behavior: one primary session makes the bounded correction without SDD,
a wiki, or a worker swarm.

## Runtime evidence record

Store a transcript or durable report with:

```text
CLIENT:
CLIENT_VERSION:
MODEL:
OS:
INSTALL_SOURCE:
RELEASE_OR_COMMIT:
SKILL_SHA256:
INVOCATION: CANONICAL_EXPLICIT | IMPLICIT_DESCRIPTION
PROMPT:
SKILL_DISCOVERED:
FIRST_WRITE_BEFORE_GATE: YES | NO
RESULT: PASS | FAIL | BLOCKED
SESSION_HEALTH_GATE:
RUNTIME_RELEASE:
OWNED_WORKER_READBACK:
EVIDENCE_PATH:
```

Marketplace screenshots, manifest parsing, an installer exit code, or a skill
appearing on disk do not replace this acceptance test.

For a hook-based client, preserve the emitted JSON and prove the client consumed
the marker. For OpenCode or Pi, preserve both adapter logs/readback and the first
model action. A prompt that pastes the skill body does not prove discovery. A
valid explicit `$nobrainer-tech-flow` run proves explicit loading, not automatic routing.

## Optional bounded command runtime (1.7.0)

The Sessions helper runs explicit argv commands using Python 3.11+ on POSIX.
It is opt-in and ships with the skill; no daemon or new hook registration is
required. Windows process-group enforcement is unsupported. The eighteen
plain-text skills remain portable; this helper does not narrow their format
compatibility. See [runtime limits and examples](BOUNDED_RUNNER.md).

## Session restart capability levels

The `session-restart` mode shipped in v1.8.0 and refined in v1.8.1 is a
client/model-neutral Sessions
protocol. The optional Python 3.11+ helper evaluates observations and runs without
a model or client SDK. It does not implement native creation or archival.
Explicit nobrainer-tech-flow entry invokes startup naming and health assessment through `nobrainer-tech-flow`.
This is agent-executed care; no native transport backend is bundled.
Human-readable startup and rollover titles use `<stable task title> | started DD-MM` where a
host supports create-time titles or rename. The registry retains the full start
timestamp and timezone, and IDs remain authoritative. A client without title
mutation reports that cosmetic capability as unsupported; this is not a failed
transfer and no universal rename API is implied.

- No hooks: the model checks at task boundaries and prepares durable progress.
- Hooks: a reviewed client adapter may supply normalized observations and invoke
  the helper; hook names and output envelopes remain client-specific.
- Native sessions: automatic rotation additionally requires fresh creation, exact
  identity/readback, shared checkpoint access and authoritative ownership transfer.
- No archive API: a verified successor can continue with source archive pending.
- No safe transport/ownership: manual handoff; no hidden worker substitution.

Existing client-load evidence does not establish restart support. Native
end-to-end restart, all-model behavior and net cost savings are unverified until
tested separately for the exact adapter/client version. No global hooks are
installed by enabling portable instructions. See [the guide](SESSION_RESTART.md).
# Optional typed-decision runtime

The eighteen-skill Markdown lifecycle requires only the host's existing model.
Jev/Laya are optional profiles, off by default; Python and model access are not
core prerequisites. See [configuration](../skills/nobrainer-tech-flow/references/optional-decisions.md).

| Profile | Required only when enabled | Current proof |
|---|---|---|
| Core | Host able to follow project instructions | Existing host-specific evidence below; no universal runtime assertion |
| Jev shadow | Python 3, authorized TypeSafe key and HTTPS access | Live synthetic Noul/Choice/Score via direct Jev 1.13.0 on macOS |
| Laya shadow | Apple Silicon, separately installed Laya-MLX, cached model and compatible Python | Live synthetic Noul/Choice/Score with multilingual MLX checkpoint, offline loading on macOS |

Typed-answer validity is not semantic correctness: Laya assigned a middling
urgency score to the no-deadline fixture. Do not advertise equivalence or
promote suggestions into hard decisions based on this smoke test. Per-call
timings include process/model startup and are not warm inference benchmarks.
No clean-session proof for a new harness is implied by these helper tests.
